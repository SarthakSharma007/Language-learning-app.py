# Language Learning Flashcards App

This is a simple Python program designed to help users learn Spanish by quizzing them with English-to-Spanish flashcards. The app randomly presents English words and asks users to provide their Spanish translations. The app evaluates the user's responses and provides feedback on whether the answer is correct or not. It also keeps track of the user's score.
